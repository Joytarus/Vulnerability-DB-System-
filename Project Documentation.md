## Introduction

Vulnerability Database offers a robust platform dedicated to the documentation, tracking, and understanding of software vulnerabilities and educational blogs. Designed with cybersecurity professionals, software developers, and enthusiasts in mind, the platform emphasizes both security and user experience.

---

## System Requirements

### Software:

- Node.js (v14+)
- PostgreSQL (v12+)
- Express.js (v4+)
- Prisma (latest)
- Vue.js (latest)
- Modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

---

## Setup & Installation

### Backend:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate: `cd backend`.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Configure PostgreSQL and set credentials in `.env`.
5. Run migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev --preview-feature`.
6. Start server: `node server.js`.

### Frontend:

1. Navigate: `cd frontend`.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Serve the frontend: `npm run serve`.

## System Architecture

### Backend:

- **Express.js**: Manages the RESTful API, facilitating CRUD operations for vulnerabilities, blogs, and user operations.
- **Prisma**: ORM for easy database operations, bridging between Express and PostgreSQL.

### Frontend:

- **Vue.js**: Provides an SPA (Single Page Application) with dedicated components for various functionalities.

---

## API Endpoints

### Authentication:

- **POST** `/register`: Registers a user. Requires `email` and `password`.
- **POST** `/login`: Authenticates a user. Returns JWT token.

### Vulnerabilities:

- **GET** `/vulnerabilities`: Fetches all vulnerabilities.
- **POST** `/vulnerabilities`: Adds a vulnerability. Requires authentication.
- **PUT** `/vulnerabilities/:id`: Modifies a vulnerability by its ID. Requires authentication.
- **DELETE** `/vulnerabilities/:id`: Removes a vulnerability by its ID. Requires authentication.

### Blogs:

- **GET** `/blogs`: Fetches all blogs.
- **POST** `/blogs`: Adds a new blog post. Requires authentication.

---

## Database Structure

### User:

- **id**: Integer (Primary Key, Auto-Increment)
- **email**: String (Unique)
- **password**: String (Encrypted)
- **posts**: Relation to Blog

### Vulnerability:

- **id**: Integer (Primary Key, Auto-Increment)
- **title**: String
- **description**: String
- ... (other fields)

### Blog:

- **id**: Integer (Primary Key, Auto-Increment)
- **title**: String
- **content**: String
- **authorId**: Foreign Key (User)
- **publishedDate**: Date

---

## Frontend Architecture

### Components:

1. **Navbar**: Navigation panel containing links to main sections, including user authentication.
2. **VulnerabilitiesList**: Lists all vulnerabilities in a paginated format.
3. **BlogView**: Displays the contents of a specific blog post.
4. **UserAuthModal**: Modal component for both registration and login functionality.

---

## Security Features

- **bcrypt.js**: Encrypts user passwords prior to storage.
- **JWT**: Ensures user sessions are secure. Tokens have a 1-hour expiration.
- **HTTPS**: It's essential to serve the application over HTTPS, ensuring data remains encrypted in transit.

---

## Troubleshooting & FAQs

**Q:** Unable to post a blog?
**A:** Ensure you're authenticated. Only logged-in users can add posts.

... (Include additional FAQs as necessary)
