        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            At VulnDB, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy
            explains how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information in
            connection with our website and services.
        </p>
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            We collect information that you provide to us directly, such as your name,
            email address, and any other information you choose to provide when you
            sign up for our services or contact us.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also collect information automatically when you use our website, such
            as your IP address, browser type, and operating system. We may use cookies
            and other tracking technologies to collect this information.
        </p>
        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
            We use your information to provide and improve our services, to respond to
            your inquiries and requests, and to communicate with you about our services
            and promotions.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may also use your information to personalize your experience on our
            website and to analyze how our website is used.
        </p>
        <h2>Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
        <p>
            We may disclose your information to third-party service providers who help
            us provide our services, such as hosting providers and payment processors.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may also disclose your information if required by law or if we believe
            that such disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or the rights of
            others, or to prevent fraud or other illegal activity.
        </p>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized
            access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the
            internet or electronic storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee
            absolute security.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material
            changes, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice on our website
            prior to the change becoming effective. Your continued use of our website
            after the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy constitutes your
            acceptance of the terms.
